# Shapescape World Settings
A filter that sets some properties in the `level.dat` file. Based on the  `release_config.json` file.

> **Warning**
> 
> The filter modifies the `level.dat` file which is not part of the RP, BP or data folders typically used by Regolith. This means that the file is not protected by Regolith and the changes made by this filter are not reversible. It is recommended to make a backup of the file before running this filter.
